# About Me

Hi there! I'm Jean and I'm happy that you found my site. Here are several facts that help you know me:

- I was born and raised in Anhui, China. My hometown is most known for _Mount Huang_, which is also my surname
- I studied in Fudan University for undergraduate, and obtained a BSc degree in physics
- I'm currently a student in London Business School pursuing a Masters in Analytics and Management degree. I created this website in my first class there - _Applied Statistics_, taught by the gorgeous bastard _Kostis_
- My current plan is to kick off my career as a strategy consultant
- I have a ragdoll cat back home. She is now 14 months old and her name is my childhood nickname _Snowball_
